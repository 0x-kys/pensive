# Pensive

a tiny database that stores structured data and unstructured embeddings, with semantic search and hybrid queries

## Core features

- SQLite-backed storage engine for structured documents
- embedding index with cosine similarity search
- optional FAISS flat index for faster vector retrieval
- hybrid query execution (structured filters + semantic ranking)
- incremental persistence for efficient local writes

## Installation & Usage

### Requirements

- Python `uv` (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

```bash
# initialized database
uv run cli.py init

# add a document
uv run cli.py add notes.txt

# run a semantic search with filters
uv run cli.py search "something cool to search" --top-k 3 --filter "some-filter-word" --filter "some-filter-word"

# delete the database
uv run cli.py clean
```
